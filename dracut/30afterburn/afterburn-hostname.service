# Azure needs to fetch the hostname in the initramfs
ConditionKernelCommandLine=|ignition.platform.id=azure

# We order this service after sysroot has been mounted
# but before ignition-files stage has run, so ignition can
# overwrite the configured hostname with e.g. a static one
# Also order after ignition-remount-sysroot just for
# safety for systems that mount /sysroot ro

ExecStart=/usr/bin/afterburn --cmdline --hostname=/sysroot/etc/hostname
# Add hack to mark the file as needing relabelling, as the hostname
# file dropped by afterburn will be unlabelled causing SELinux denials.
